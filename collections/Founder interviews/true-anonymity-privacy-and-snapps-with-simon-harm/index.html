<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYrrbRbKZ1V71tGphnoR6WEbk5frDMwjAdC1Dwz3RvmQZ" /></p>
<p>In this Blockwatch, I speak with Simon Harman, project lead at <a href="https://loki.network">Loki</a>, who provides a refreshing, honest, and realistic perspective on Blockchain and privacy.</p>
<p>Hear the full interview in the audio version, but here are the highlights to whet your appetite.</p>
<iframe src="https://anchor.fm/theweeklysqueak/embed/episodes/Decentralised-Privacy-with-Loki-Network-e36f94" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<h3 id="what-is-loki">What is Loki?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-loki" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Loki is an intertwined, decentralized privacy ecosystem that allows users to take advantage of a P2P network of service nodes to browse, transact, and communicate online as anonymously and securely as possible.</p>
<p>The team chose the name Loki as it reflects the trickery of the implementation; one of the aspects that resulted in an anonymous, private, and secure solution.</p>
<p>The Loki mixnet, Lokinet, is so secure and anonymous that even the servers handling messages don't know where they are going.</p>
<p>The goal of Loki is to enable Internet users to send end-to-end encrypted messages and voice calls without exposing their identity or IP address. Therefore, personal information can never be compromised, and metadata cannot be used to place ads.</p>
<p>Unlike Tor - where anyone can spin up a server and become a relay - Loki requires relays to have a stake in the network (it's how they are authenticated). Plus, network users can vote relays off the network if they act against the network interests.</p>
<p>According to Simon's calculations, it would cost around $40,000-$50,000 a month to launch a Sybil attack on the Tor network. Simon says figures like these make it economically viable to monitor a single Tor user's activities.</p>
<p>Loki hopes to create a network that a single entity cannot manipulate, and is effectively Sybil attack resistant. Something that places it ahead of Tor and other privacy mixnets.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-the-freedom-of-speech">Protecting the freedom of speech<a class="headerlink" href="#protecting-the-freedom-of-speech" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Loki stands for absolute privacy by default.</p>
<p>For a start, Node operators cannot see the content of transactions and interactions. Furthermore, they either know where information has come from or where it's going (never both), which makes censorship difficult.</p>
<p>The entire Loki project team has been keen on Monero, Tor, and other privacy projects for a long time. One of the reasons for this is because they are some of the few platforms still seeking to defy censorship and protect the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>As Simon explains, while some of the things content creators say aren't always popular, what right do large corporations and oppressive regimes have to censor and de-platform them?</p>
<p>The Internet - something that was once free and beautiful - has become controlled by large organizations, and it's a case of following their ideals or be silenced, Simon says.</p>
<h3 id="why-loki-messenger-will-probably-never-be-a-mainstream-app">Why Loki Messenger will (probably) never be a mainstream app<a class="headerlink" href="#why-loki-messenger-will-probably-never-be-a-mainstream-app" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Loki Messenger is in active development, but as Simon points out, one of the difficulties when developing a messaging app is that users want it fully-featured from the offset.</p>
<p>Adoption of a bespoke privacy messaging app is a slower process than mainstream alternatives, but if it lacks features, then Loki starts at a massive disadvantage.</p>
<p>As Simon says, instant messaging users expect to fully control their messages, with their conversations synced across multiple devices and emoji support as a minimum. That's why the Loki team is reluctant to release Loki Messenger until this functionality is in place.</p>
<h3 id="add-your-application-to-loki-with-snapps">Add your application to Loki with SNApps<a class="headerlink" href="#add-your-application-to-loki-with-snapps" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You can host any web application on Lokinet as a SNApp, enabling users to host a suite of private hidden web applications. Find out how to get started with the process in <a href="https://lokidocs.com/Lokinet/Guides/HostingSNApps/">the SNApp documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Simon told me that Loki developers have come up with a challenge to find something that doesn't run as a SNApp. In contrast to other decentralized networks, this opens Loki to a world of existing applications that need little or no modification to run on their network.</p>
<p>If you have an application that needs privacy and anonymity, then Loki is a new option for you to try and I'd welcome hearing your experiences in the comments below.</p>
