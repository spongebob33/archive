<h3 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>This guide walks you through understanding, installing, and using Swarm. It also explains how to contribute or ask for help. Swarm is in active development and it is untested in the wild, so use it at your own risk. To interact with Swarm, you will need to use the command line. If you are not comfortable using it, it might be worth to familiarise yourself <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">here</a> first.</p>

<p>Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the ethereum <code>web3</code> stack. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as blockchain data. From an economic point of view, it allows participants to efficiently pool their storage and bandwidth resources in order to provide these services to all participants of the network, all while being incentivised by Ethereum.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#objective" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Swarm's broader objective is to provide infrastructure services for developers of decentralised web applications (dapps), notably: messaging, data streaming, peer to peer accounting, mutable resource updates, storage insurance, proof of custody scan and repair, payment channels and database services.</p>
<p>From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from the world wide web, with the exception that uploads are not hosted on a specific server. Swarm offers a peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDoS-resistant, has zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment. Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution (using ENS), service payments and content availability insurance.</p>
<p>Please refer to our <a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/wiki/roadmap">development roadmap</a> to stay informed with our progress.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Swarm is set out to provide base layer infrastructure for a new decentralised internet.
Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of nodes providing distributed digital services by contributing resources (storage, message forwarding, payment processing) to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.
<img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmdy3VB8srRFmpSTN2aUGUCVgHFT1dQmcfrTjoJJU1cYRr" /></p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation operates a Swarm testnet that can be used to test out functionality in a similar manner to the Ethereum testnet (ropsten).
Everyone can join the network by running the Swarm client node on their server, desktop, laptop or mobile device. See <code>Getting Started</code> for how to do this.
The Swarm client is part of the Ethereum stack, the reference implementation is written in golang and found under the go-ethereum repository. Currently at POC (proof of concept) version 0.3 is running on all nodes.</p>
<p>Uploaded content is <strong>not guaranteed to persist on the testnet</strong> until storage insurance is implemented (see <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ethersphere/projects/5">Roadmap</a> for more details). All participating nodes should consider participation a voluntary service with no formal obligation whatsoever and should be expected to delete content at their will. Therefore, users should <strong>under no circumstances regard Swarm as safe storage</strong> until the incentive system is functional.</p>
<p>Swarm offers a <strong>local HTTP proxy</strong> API that dapps or command line tools can use to interact with Swarm. Some modules like <a href="PSS">messaging</a> are only available through RPC-JSON API. The foundation servers on the testnet are offering public gateways, which serve to easily demonstrate functionality and allow free access so that people can try Swarm without even running their own node.</p>
<p>Swarm is a collection of nodes of the devp2p network each of which run the BZZ URL schemes on the same network id.</p>
<p>Swarm nodes can also connect with one (or several) Ethereum blockchains for domain name resolution and one ethereum blockchain for bandwidth and storage compensation.
Nodes running the same network id are supposed to connect to the same blockchain for payments. A Swarm network is identified by its network id which is an arbitrary integer.</p>
<p>Swarm allows for :dfn:<code>upload and disappear</code> which means that any node can just upload content to the Swarm and then is allowed to go offline. As long as nodes do not drop out or become unavailable, the content will still be accessible due to the 'synchronization' procedure in which nodes continuously pass along available data between each other.</p>
<p>Swarm supports encryption. Upload of unencrypted sensitive and private data is highly discouraged as <strong>there is no way to undo an upload</strong>. Users should refrain from uploading illegal, controversial or unethical content. </p>
<p>Always use encryption for sensitive content. For encrypted content, uploaded data is 'protected', i.e. only those that know the reference to the root chunk (the Swarm hash of the file) as well as the decryption key can access the content. Since publishing this reference (on ENS or with Feeds) requires an extra step, users are mildly protected against careless publishing as long as they use encryption. Even though there is no guarantees for removal, unaccessed content that is not explicitly insured will eventually disappear from the Swarm, as nodes will be incentivised to garbage collect it in case of storage capacity limits. </p>
<p>Swarm is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure&gt;">Persistent Data Structure</a>, therefore there is no notion of delete/remove action in Swarm. This is because content is disseminated to Swarm nodes who are incentivised to serve it.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> It is not possible to <strong>delete or remove</strong> content uploaded to Swarm. <strong>Always encrypt</strong> sensitive content using the integrated Swarm encryption.</p>
<h3 id="available-apis">Available APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#available-apis" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Swarm offers several APIs:
 * CLI
 * JSON-RPC - using web3 bindings over Geth's IPC
 * HTTP interface - every Swarm node exposes a local HTTP proxy that implements the :ref:<code>BZZ URL schemes</code>
 * Javascript - available through the <a href="https://erebos.js.org">erebos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MaiaVictor/swarm-js">swarm-js</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swarmgw">swarmgw</a> packages</p>

<p>Roadmap is located at https://github.com/ethersphere/Swarm/wiki/roadmap</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Swarm is experimental code and untested in the wild. Use with extreme care. We encourage developers to connect to the testnet with their permanent nodes and give us feedback.</p>
<h3 id="public-gateways">Public gateways<a class="headerlink" href="#public-gateways" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Swarm offers a local HTTP proxy API that Dapps can use to interact with Swarm. The Ethereum Foundation is hosting a public gateway, which allows free access so that people can try Swarm without running their own node.</p>
<p>The Swarm public gateway can be found at https://swarm-gateways.net and is always running the latest <code>stable</code> Swarm release.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Swarm public gateways are temporary and users should not rely on their existence for production services.</p>
