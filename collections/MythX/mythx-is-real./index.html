<p><em>myth: n: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone, especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of society</em>
 ( 
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth">Source</a>
 )</p>
<p>The world of Ethereum is full of myths. Decentralization. Autonomy. Code is law. These are all tenets that we as an ecosystem have chosen to put top-of-mind in our work.
There is one tenet that hasn’t had as much success: security.
Smart Contracts and dApps offer countless new possibilities. With the responsibility for our own security, we can no longer ignore the fact that there are those with a tremendous incentive to attack the systems we build. The stakes are high, and 
<strong>security must not be a last-minute fix</strong>
 . It has to be fundamental to the development process. No one wants to be the next headline.
But let’s be honest; if securing our contracts were easy, we wouldn’t have these high-profile cases. With weak points at many stages of the process, from the language used to the version of the compiler, it’s understandable to feel a little at a loss. (We recently 
<a href="https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/consensys-diligence-ether-giveaway-1-4985627b7726">showcased a contract through a hacking challenge</a>
 that was seemingly invulnerable before Constantinople, but after the upgrade, actually 
<a href="https://samczsun.com/consensys-ctf-writeup/">became hackable</a>
 .)
We understand what you’re up against.
That’s why we created 
<a href="https://mythx.io">MythX.</a></p>
<p><strong>MythX is a security analysis platform for Ethereum smart contracts.</strong></p>
<p>It allows any developer or development team to perform a comprehensive range of industry-leading analyses on smart contracts, including an input fuzzer, a static code analyzer, linter, and a symbolic analyzer. All accessible through an easy-to-use API.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmPZkcXri2nwKgBGkT1tb9kMSj9Liv1oKHT86YQ5T5Ruaz" /></p>
<p>MythX was built by a team at 
<a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/">ConsenSys Diligence</a>
 , leaders in professional smart contract audits.</p>
<p><strong>Today we’re announcing the release of the public beta of the MythX platform.</strong></p>
<p>This means that you have access to all of the analyses and tools, for free, for a limited time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmNrp7tinAZRaVyRS11P4eYdHB58ZkWvPTcyV8xGKhMFLE" /></p>
<p>We want you to use the service. Overuse it even. We’re offering professional audit capabilities without needing to hire anyone!
And while MythX doesn’t replace 
<a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/">a professional audit</a>
 , it can be used at any point during the development process, making the eventual audit quicker, easier, and therefore cheaper.
This is 
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/build-first-hodl-never-why-were-calling-off-our-token-and-using-stable-coins-instead-46af203af697">not an ICO</a>
 . This is not a prospective product that will be available “at some point soon, pending funding”. This is available 
<em>now</em>
 for anyone to use.
You can use MythX with Truffle through the 
<a href="https://docs.mythx.io/en/latest/tooling/truffle.html">Truffle Security</a>
 plugin. We also have JavaScript and Python libraries, and many more integrations on the way. ( 
<a href="https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/why-you-should-buidl-on-mythx-api-and-earn-revenue-share-in-dai-13d8bc7ca803">We’re looking for integrators</a>
 to build new connections for MythX too. Hit us up on 
<a href="https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt">Discord</a>
 if you’re interested in this challenge.)
We are moving beyond the hype cycle. These days, it’s what you can produce that counts. It’s what you ship that matters. We care about what’s real.
And MythX is real.
Use it to help make your products real too. Let’s make security top of mind, and increase trust in our trustless ecosystem.</p>
