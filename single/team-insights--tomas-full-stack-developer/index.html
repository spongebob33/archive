<h4 id="hi-tomas-welcome-to-the-team-its-awesome-to-have-you-could-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-you-and-your-background">Hi Tomás! Welcome to the team, it’s awesome to have you! Could you tell us a bit about you and your background?<a class="headerlink" href="#hi-tomas-welcome-to-the-team-its-awesome-to-have-you-could-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-you-and-your-background" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Hello and thank you! Well, I consider myself 
<strong>a curious person who enjoys learning and who is passionate about programming</strong>
 .
I discovered this fondness for coding when I joined a software engineering degree. I began studying web technologies all by myself back then. Soon after that, I made the decision to give up University — with the aim of finishing the degree in the future — 
<strong>in order to keep learning on a more practical note by working on real projects</strong>
 . With that in mind, I joined a web development bootcamp and right afterwards I was hired at El Corte Inglés’ UX department, where I developed the “Mi Cuenta” project over the last year.</p>
<h4 id="opportunities-are-abundant-for-full-stack-developers-in-many-industries-what-attracted-you-to-work-in-the-crypto-space">Opportunities are abundant for full stack developers in many industries. What attracted you to work in the crypto space?<a class="headerlink" href="#opportunities-are-abundant-for-full-stack-developers-in-many-industries-what-attracted-you-to-work-in-the-crypto-space" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>I have been curious for a while about the world of crypto. I find it very encouraging to join the development of a 
<strong>newborn technology which has many problems that need to be solved</strong>
 . Moreover, working on a project with so much potential that 
<strong>will allow many people to benefit from its underlying technology</strong>
 excites me a lot.</p>
<h4 id="you-are-passionate-about-the-possibilities-of-this-technology-what-are-your-thoughts-on-smart-contracts-and-their-current-and-future-usecases">You are passionate about the possibilities of this technology. What are your thoughts on smart contracts and their current and future usecases?<a class="headerlink" href="#you-are-passionate-about-the-possibilities-of-this-technology-what-are-your-thoughts-on-smart-contracts-and-their-current-and-future-usecases" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>I believe that the possibilities of this technology are tremendous, but we should not give in to use it as a universal tool in order to confront every problem. Having said this, 
<strong>we are about to live a revolution that goes beyond strictly affecting the financial system</strong>
 , as many other sectors will benefit from the features of decentralized networks.
I believe we are also about to observe the creation of companies based on new business models sustained by this technology, most of which has yet to be fully explored.</p>
<h4 id="in-crypto-there-are-some-great-projects-working-on-inspiring-missions-what-attracted-you-to-witnet-and-what-would-you-say-is-the-potential-of-the-project">In crypto, there are some great projects working on inspiring missions. What attracted you to Witnet and what would you say is the potential of the project?<a class="headerlink" href="#in-crypto-there-are-some-great-projects-working-on-inspiring-missions-what-attracted-you-to-witnet-and-what-would-you-say-is-the-potential-of-the-project" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Among the reasons as to why I feel attracted to Witnet are 
<strong>working with a top level technical team</strong>
 from which I can learn as well as the possibility of 
<strong>working on a challenging project that offers a solution to ‘the oracle problem’</strong>
 . Providing a trustless way to feed information into a smart contract that runs trustlessly we will be able to support and boost further adoption of blockchain technology.</p>
<h4 id="as-a-developer-what-kind-of-tools-do-you-use-and-what-makes-them-appropriate-for-your-work">As a developer, what kind of tools do you use and what makes them appropriate for your work?<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-developer-what-kind-of-tools-do-you-use-and-what-makes-them-appropriate-for-your-work" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Basically I use the UNIX environment, visual studio code as my code editor and Firefox as my default browser. In addition, I like using Hyper with ZSH as my terminal and I have a particular weakness for fonts with ligatures like Fira code.</p>
<h4 id="to-wrap-up-what-are-some-things-that-you-like-to-do-outside-of-your-work-life">To wrap up, what are some things that you like to do outside of your work life?<a class="headerlink" href="#to-wrap-up-what-are-some-things-that-you-like-to-do-outside-of-your-work-life" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Outside of the office, I also spend my time coding because I enjoy it very much. I have fun on web pages with 
<strong>code challenges</strong>
 like Codewars and discovering new languages — which also involves discovering new software paradigms.
However, as not everything in life is about programming, 
<strong>I’m studying Arabic and I like spending my time reading or playing video games</strong>
 . On the other hand, I’m into playing chess and cooking when I have any time left. I especially like baking my own bread!</p>
