<p><strong>I’ve always been passionate about technology in general and about the internet in particular</strong>
 . I remember when my father brought home a modem when I was 13, in 1994, and 
<strong>my life changed forever</strong>
 . Since then, I’ve been really fascinated about both the hacker culture and the cypherpunk scene. In my teens I used to spend countless hours chatting on IRC and lurking in Usenet newsgroups. I loved to tinker with 
<strong>public key cryptography</strong>
 — it was something truly fascinating for me. Not because I had anything secret or that I didn’t want to share, but because I felt that through cryptography individuals had the possibility to 
<strong>claim radical ownership of their personal space</strong>
 , reducing the coercive power others have over them.
I’ve also been 
<strong>building companies</strong>
 since I was quite young. I failed most of the times, but I succeeded enough to keep trying. Finally, in 2016 I started doing my own 
<a href="https://angel.co/daniele-levi">investing in startups</a>
 .</p>
<h4 id="from-that-perspective-what-did-you-find-most-attractive-about-the-crypto-space-in-the-first-place">From that perspective, what did you find most attractive about the crypto space in the first place?<a class="headerlink" href="#from-that-perspective-what-did-you-find-most-attractive-about-the-crypto-space-in-the-first-place" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>As you might imagine, when I first read about 
<strong>Bitcoin</strong>
 in late 2012, everything made sense to me. I felt I was witnessing the initial moments of an 
<strong>historical revolution, one that I had to live in the frontline</strong>
 . Since then, I’ve dedicated 100% of my time to Bitcoin first, and other related technologies later. In this space I’ve done a few things. I ran a mining operation in 2012 and 2013, then I tried (and failed) to create an exchange in early 2013. 
<strong>In 2014 I co-founded</strong> <a href="https://stampery.com/">Stampery</a>
 .</p>
<h4 id="for-people-who-might-not-know-the-details-whats-witnet-and-why-is-this-technology-relevant">For people who might not know the details, what’s Witnet and why is this technology relevant?<a class="headerlink" href="#for-people-who-might-not-know-the-details-whats-witnet-and-why-is-this-technology-relevant" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p><a href="http://witnet.io">Witnet</a> <strong>is a decentralized oracle network: a fundamental piece of infrastructure for the future, decentralized internet</strong>
 . Smart contracts are very exciting technology, but they’re missing something crucial: 
<strong>the ability to retrieve information from external data sources in a decentralized way</strong>
 . Right now, smart contracts are either self-referential or they rely on centralized systems for retrieving data. This at best limits their utility, and at worst introduces dangerous points of failure that by themselves invalidate the 
<strong>core value proposals of smart contracts</strong>
 .
If we want to deliver on the promise of smart contracts, on top of having a decentralized execution environment we need to be able to 
<strong>feed them information in a trustless way</strong>
 . That’s what Witnet is for.</p>

<p>On the short term, I’m very excited about 
<strong>building and growing the team</strong>
 . The feedback from the community is great and there’s a lot of incredible talent willing to help us to solve the oracle problem. I’m also very driven by the sight of the 
<strong>prototype we’re launching very soon</strong>
 . On the longer term, my dream is 
<strong>to see Witnet empowering smart contract developers all over the world</strong>
 .</p>
<h4 id="the-crypto-ecosystem-is-flooded-with-talent-what-are-some-of-your-favourite-projects">The crypto ecosystem is flooded with talent. What are some of your favourite projects?<a class="headerlink" href="#the-crypto-ecosystem-is-flooded-with-talent-what-are-some-of-your-favourite-projects" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>I will start with my first love in the crypto space: 
<strong>Bitcoin</strong>
 . To me, It is 
<strong>the best hedge against the failure of the traditional financial system</strong>
 . I see it as an insurance against a dystopic future. Also, as a long term store of value, Bitcoin has no rivals. If you understand that being a decentralized, digital store of value is its main role you also understand that the fact that it is very difficult to change is not a bug, but a feature. Having a reliable digital store of value that is censorship resistant, easy to transfer and transport, and very difficult to seize is 
<strong>radically empowering for people</strong>
 .</p>
<p>I’m also greatly into 
<strong>Ethereum</strong>
 . While Bitcoin gives people the opportunity to really take ownership of their money (in a radical way), Ethereum 
<strong>redefines how people do business with each other</strong>
 . A new kind of relationship is possible in which corruption, coercion and extortion are taken out of the equation. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Other projects I like: 
<strong>Lighting Network</strong>
 . I love this approach for scaling bitcoin. We will see if it works as designed, but in any case it’s going to be really interesting to watch. I also like a lot what 
<a href="http://aragon.one">Aragon</a> and <a href="https://district0x.io/">District0x</a> are doing in their fields of work. Another innovation that fascinates me quite a lot is 
<strong>Non Fungible Tokens</strong>
 . The concept of digital, decentralized scarcity will create completely new businesses and creative models we cannot even imagine today.</p>

<p><strong>I really enjoy music</strong>
 . I was a professional DJ for some years, and I still dj as an amateur today. I buy vinyl records compulsively. Usually not two weeks go by without me receiving some at home or at the office. I have a collection of 
<strong>thousands of electronic music vinyls</strong>
 — especially underground Chicago house and Detroit techno, but also electro or ambient. 
<strong>I also love travelling, reading, enjoying good food, playing chess and spending time with my family</strong>
 .</p>
