<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Never stop learning new things in your space. When you find something interesting, write about it. Don’t just open source your code, screencast about it. You don’t have to be a genius to contribute to the ecosystem. Listen to the smart people around you and try to make something that will be interesting to them.</p>
<p>Spend every waking moment, that isn’t at work or with family, hacking on something even if you are building digital sandcastles. You’ll learn so much and you might just catch a lucky break!</p>

<p>In November of 2017, almost one year ago, I started building products on Ethereum. My first project was a decentralized oracle exploration called 
<a href="http://concurrence.io">Concurrence.io</a>
 . To be honest, I didn’t have the chops to put together a sound cryptoeconmic system. It worked in ideal cases, but 
<em>no one really cared</em>
 .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVtMBvikNnREkv2kcZcnrWZJ8r2yJc5NjTFM6sZqQEodP" /></p>
<p>From this first Ethereum project, 
<a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/clevis">Clevis</a>
 was born. Similar to Truffle, Clevis helps me build, test, and orchestrate my dApps. I tried to release Clevis publically and you can see the initial video at the bottom of the repo. 
<em>No one really cared. It wasn’t 10x better than something that already existed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something truly defeating about showing off something you love and getting no response at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmUabQ425RkTk9Zd85G6Y9A97ShDTmPKj4yeMERh7RrySk" /></p>
<p>Next, I decided to build a game called 
<a href="http://galleass.io">Galleass</a>
 . It’s a hand painted resource management game loosely based in the age of sail. I wanted to utilize token standards like ERC20 and ERC721 but in a new way… 
<em>crafting</em>
 .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmdbA6F5Jq1Tv8XtCj7XDLPkWr1jPXAcF2uFXAVyHxBBut" /></p>
<p>The first phase of the game is fishing. You craft a Dogger (ERC721 fishing boat) by sending 4 Timber (ERC20) using a transferAndCall() (ERC677). Then you “sail on the blockchain” to a location to cast your bait in a commit/reveal randomness scheme to catch fish (ERC20).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmP8FUq65c9opE5mFeWuatdC6h1ArSXr8kq9CN8w7oeXen" /></p>
<p>A really neat mechanic that emerged from a fully decentralized game is each deployment goes to IPFS. Not only do players own their own assets and identity, but if they don’t like an update I push, they can go play the old version as if each iteration is a hard fork.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmNoznUHfSNkXjNVJn5vKkiccKwoJbRPiRfxaSptRyP6Zx" /></p>
<p>Galleass still exists out on the Rinkeby and Ropsten, but there were so many contracts it just wasn’t worth auditing. I learned a lot from building it and you can 
<a href="https://austingriffith.com/portfolio/galleass/">read more here</a>
 . I tried to promote it on /r/ethereum and /r/ethdev but it got 
<em>downvoted into oblivion. No one could make money from playing it.</em></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQejya28jPuxRM6ZWXj3GPypqjKdKZRot4oGapcNUJnNM" /></p>
<p>I stuck with game design and at 
<a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETHDenver</a>
 we got a team together to create 
<a href="http://cryptogs.io">Cryptogs</a>
 . It’s the game of pogs on the blockchain. We thought this would be a perfect use of the ERC721 standard; true digital ownership of provably rare goods. At the time it was one of the only mainnet games that you could actually 
<em>play</em>
 . In the long run, 
<em>nobody really cared</em>
 . 
<em>The interface was just too clunky and expensive. On top of the failure, I burned a bridge with my teammate,</em></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@watch84">Jonathan Gorczyca</a></p>
<p><em>and you never get that back. Life lessons learned.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>I was spread thin. My wife wasn’t seeing value in my late night work and the word blockchain was officially off limits at our house. On top of that I was still very much on the outside looking in. I really wanted to go to devcon but I had no idea how to attract the right attention to my work:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>Personal Goal: Attend #devcon4!

How do I get to Prague?</p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/995382782942588928">@austingriffith</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was a (lame) cry for help to get to Prague and it went completely unanswered. Not a single like, response, or retweet. If I could go back in time and talk to this version of myself we would have a heart to heart about the value I was providing to the ecosystem. Yes, past Austin, you have some build experience and some fun projects, but you have to look at it objectively from the lens of other developers in the space. What are you doing for 
<em>them</em>
 ? Nothing, dude.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to build an organic following, you have to answer an important question and that answer has to be 10x better than any existing solution.</strong>
 The only way to get there is to listen, build, learn, and iterate.
I had a long way to go.</p>
<hr />
<p>Throughout the spring and early summer of 2018 I put together a handful of small projects. First, I created a 
<a href="https://austingriffith.com/portfolio/blockieminer/">Blockie Miner</a>
 to show how we need to be careful about how we use Ethereum Identicons.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>On the left is an icon for an ethereum address that I use constantly. <a href="http://twitter.com/austingriffith" target="_blank" title="Twitter profile for @austingriffith">@austingriffith</a> built an identicon miner and I requested him to try to spoof it. This is the result after only 45 minutes. Imagine if he had left it running for a day or more!</p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1017785526403981312">@avsa</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For the first time in my Ethereum career, someone noticed. 
<a href="https://medium.com/@avsa">Alex Van de Sande</a>
 retweeted my project and it felt awesome! Maybe I had built something the ecosystem was interested in, 
<a href="https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427">I shilled it as much as I could</a>
 , but it really was just one-off demo. I needed to keep exploring, learning, and #buidling and this excitement fueled me.</p>
<hr />
<p>I tried to build or document anything I found interesting or helpful. When I ran into an issue with the React service worker and web3, 
<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/react-service-worker-web3-android-98970a6691ad">I wrote about it</a>
 and it made it to 
<a href="https://medium.com/@evan_van_ness">Evan Van Ness</a>
 ’s 
<a href="http://www.weekinethereum.com/">WeekInEthereum</a>
 . When I figured out how to get a Geth node running on a $35 compute stick, 
<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/going-fully-decentralized-on-the-cheap-33e6e718131a">I wrote about it</a>
 and tagged 
<a href="https://medium.com/@peter_szilagyi">Péter Szilágyi</a>
 . When 
<a href="https://medium.com/@weka">Nick Johnson</a>
 held a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1009112083772919814">solidity golf tournament</a>
 and needed a solc api, I built it over night while on vacation and footed the bill for the servers. Even if I was new to the space and didn’t totally understand everything, I did whatever I could to provide value.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, I created a repository of all of my commonly used web3 React components called 
<a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/dapparatus">Dapparatus</a>
 . This integrates tightly with 
<a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/clevis">Clevis</a>
 and allows a developer to have a dApp up and running with a single command. With Dapparatus, developers can focus on building their application and not have to wrestle with the blockchain. This is when I really started spinning up my momentum by 
<a href="https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8Fclevis-blockchain-orchestration-682d2396aeef">creating screencasts and articles</a>
 . It was at this point I realized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open sourcing a tool is no longer good enough; we must evangelize and educate to drive adoption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I had a toolset for rapid dApp development, I could iterate rapidly on ideas. For the 
<a href="https://www.nifty.gg/">Nifty hackathon</a>
 I built a remote submission called 
<a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties">Nifties vs Nfties</a>
 and also poked fun of on-chain governance:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>No need to fear blockchain governance anymore, here's nifties signalling. <a href="https://t.co/Xtb1rrzuxJ" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Xtb1rrzuxJ</a></p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/5chdn/status/1021761192216469504">@5chdn</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The greatest success of the whole project was 
<a href="https://medium.com/@mattcondon">Matt Condon</a>
 putting a “Niftie” on his shoulder in his Twitter profile: 🤣💙🤣</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWBsy4jJ9R71Ws6S9rieteLKT15G3YgQdjaHrzzNqziiW" /></p>
<hr />
<p>I was getting a little more traction in the #buidl ecosystem, a little more confidence, a few more followers on Twitter. But, I was a long ways from finding a full time position in the space. 
<strong>I needed to find something of real value.</strong></p>
<hr />
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KO84Jq1jtIQ" width="512"></iframe>

<p>After 
<a href="https://medium.com/@austin_48503/galleass-io-development-update-july-18-7f08c112de64">another big development push on Galleass</a>
 , 
<strong>I found that</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_iiwok/status/1017847582565863424">user onboarding is really hard</a></p>
<p><strong>in Ethereum</strong>
 . I also found that doing every single transaction on-chain made the user experience pretty rough. 
<em>Mainstream users are never going to use this as is.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I kept up with 
<a href="https://medium.com/@avsa">Alex Van de Sande</a>
 on Twitter and one day I saw the idea of Universal Logins come across my feed:</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qF2lhJzngto" width="512"></iframe>

<p>It was my goosebumps moment. These signed transactions operating through a proxy contract could be very powerful, not just for logins, but for mainstream adoption through seamless UX.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>the difference between paying 0.000 ETH and 0.001 ETH is huge for UX. has anyone seen examples of dapps paying gas on their users behalf?</p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1021859962882908160">@owocki</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I dug in deep. I learned as much as I could about signed transactions and ecrecover() and how these “meta transactions” could be used to create a gasless experience for a user. In the long run, crypto Twitter lead me to my “big break”:</p>

<p>My first big article was 
<a href="https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84">“Ethereum Meta Transactions” — Lowering barriers to drive mass Ethereum adoption</a>
 . (“Big” relative to the previous attempts, I’m still

 in the ecosystem.)</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6r3SqCcEVU4" width="512"></iframe>

<p>For the first time I actually got some retweets from the community. It was clear that the space was ready for meta transactions. I continued to iterate and publish new content. We even found a trick to replay meta transactions and went on to win a hackathon with a 
<a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/tokensubscription.com">token subscription system</a>
 . I think this will eventually lead to the 
<a href="https://1337alliance.com/">EIP1337 standard</a>
 (much l33t!).
None of this is new, meta transactions 
<a href="https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1046434431014068224">have been around for years</a>
 , but I think the space is finally ready for the UX to get a good hard look. So I launched 
<a href="http://metatx.io">metatx.io</a>
 to help educate developers on integrating meta transactions into their current dApps and building new ones with delegated execution. If you have any questions or I can help with your project, please reach out!

<p>Because of this big break I spent last week in San Francisco hanging out with all of those dudes up there in those tweets. They went from being Twitter famous to being my friends and it comes down to the objective value I can provide along with just being a good person. I wouldn’t argue if you were to say every one of them is more intelligent than I am, but I hustle my ass off and constantly #buidling goes a long way in this space.</p>

<p>Next week we’ll all get to hang out again in Prague. I even ended up getting my devcon ticket paid for. I’ll be presenting my toolset and demonstrating how to build a gasless UX with meta transactions. 
<em>I got really lucky.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Proving meta transactions could work was one thing, but building them into a seamless UX will be something we continue to refine. 
<strong>I’m honored to announce that tomorrow I will be moving into the Ethereum development space full time.</strong>
 My job will be researching and building new ways to drive mainstream adoption with seamless UX powered by meta transactions.

<p>We still have a long way to go and I have a list a mile long that I can’t wait to tackle tomorrow. But, I’ll be doing it full time and that feels so amazing!
It can take years of nights and weekends to find that big break. Keep learning and keep building. Follow people that know more than you and try to provide them with value. You don’t know what you don’t know so be humble and listen!
Finally, don’t get caught up in the hustle so much that you lose sight of your health and wellbeing. You will be spread thin and there will be sleepless nights. But, in the long run, family is the most important thing there is. Nothing’s better than hanging out with my

 and this
