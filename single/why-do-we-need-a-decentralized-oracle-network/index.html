<p>Decentralized oracles 
<a href="https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-smart-contracts-with-real-power-f79e326da3a4">connect smart contracts to any external piece of data in a trustless way</a>
 . This retrieval of data from the real world is done following the rules of a protocol that incentivizes all nodes to tell the truth and punishes them for lying.
Yet, what are some real, tangible 
<strong>use cases for decentralized oracles</strong>
 ? This is a popular question we get from the community, and we want to address it the best way we can. The 
<strong>possibilities for this technology are endless</strong>
 , and it would be naive to say we can list them all: smart contracts will literally be able to feed on any piece of data available online.
We‚Äôll explore some of the most common concepts we have faced up to date, leaving the door open for innovators to make these examples seem obvious by defining new frontiers with their work. Let‚Äôs get started!</p>
<h3 id="prediction-markets">üîÆ Prediction Markets<a class="headerlink" href="#prediction-markets" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Prediction markets are platforms that 
<strong>allow you to buy and sell ‚Äòshares‚Äô of a certain event‚Äôs outcome</strong>
 . The more the public believes something is likely to happen, the cheaper the outcome will be, and vice versa.
For prediction markets to work in a fully decentralized way 
<strong>there has to be a mechanism in place to trustlessly assess what the true outcome of an event was</strong>
 . In that outcome validation process is where distributed oracles play a role: you can connect the market‚Äôs smart contract to external sources to check on the final result. Then, money can be distributed to the buyers that predicted the outcome correctly.</p>
<h3 id="crowdfunding">üìÖ Crowdfunding<a class="headerlink" href="#crowdfunding" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Crowdfunding is a way for everyone to 
<strong>fund projects and initiatives</strong>
 you might like or support. </p>
<hr />
<p>A very common approach to crowdfunding is to make it milestone based, so that funds are provided to teams based on when and how they reach certain milestones.
Crowdfunding can be easily conducted using smart contracts, as they are an efficient mechanism to allocate funds provided by backers. 
<strong>For smart contracts to know if a milestone has been reached by the team</strong>
 (information that escapes the reach of the contract‚Äôs code) a decentralized network of oracles can assure a truthful, secure addressing of the team‚Äôs achievements.</p>
<h3 id="finance">üí∞ Finance<a class="headerlink" href="#finance" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Finance is a broad topic, but the uses for a trustless oracle in this field are also quite broad. Accessing the 
<strong>price of any good or asset</strong>
 can‚Äôt be done without using a trusted third party: until now.</p>
<body><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>Who is working on oracles for token prices? We need to have a blend of data to get the right price. Relying on a couple of centralised services is a short-term fix. Long term, we need much more tamper-proof pricing data.</p><p>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<a href="https://twitter.com/ricburton/status/990913168254763008">@ricburton</a></p></blockquote><script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script></body>

<p>A team‚Äôs salary 
<strong>payments based on performance</strong>
 metrics can be automated. For 
<strong>stablecoins</strong>
 which are pegged to the value of some external asset (i.e. USD), there needs to be way to retrieve data about the exchange rate between the two, and a decentralized oracle network like 
<a href="http://witnet.io">Witnet</a>
 provides the best incentive system to ensure parties always tell the truth.</p>
<h3 id="insurance">üö® Insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#insurance" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>When an 
<strong>unexpected event happens</strong>
 (a robbery, a natural disaster‚Ä¶) it is common to have insurance in place to 
<strong>mitigate the risk in the best way possible</strong>
 . For insurance to work properly, parties involved need data about the state of affairs before the unexpected event, as well as afterwards.
Was that automatic door locked? Did this company have an encryption system in place? What was the damage of a flood to a certain property? For a 
<strong>smart contract to connect to all these data points from the real world without relying on corruptible intermediaries</strong>
 , a network of distributed oracles must coordinate to retrieve and verify all the necessary data.</p>
<h3 id="identity">üë§ Identity<a class="headerlink" href="#identity" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Identity is a 
<strong>popular topic in the crypto space</strong>
 . How funds, votes, or non-fungible tokens are 
<strong>tied to their owners</strong>
 is an issue many projects are working hard on solving in a decentralized way.
These blockchain based identities will be key for the 
<strong>transparent and secure development of many processes</strong>
 . At the moment, it‚Äôs quite easy to vote twice on many blockchain-based vote systems, for example, with the problems that can entail in the short and long term future. Trustless oracles will seamlessly 
<strong>connect smart contracts to the identities of voters, asset owners or medical patients</strong>
 .</p>
<h3 id="gambling">üé≤ Gambling<a class="headerlink" href="#gambling" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>Whether we‚Äôre talking about a big online Casino or a small group of people making a friendly bet, a final result must be set in order for that bet or gamble to finalize. Who won last night‚Äôs NBA game? Or how does a smart contract define ‚Äúwinning‚Äù, in the first place?
Smart contracts shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on central entities (a Casino‚Äôs management, a trusted API‚Ä¶) in order to make this call. Instead, they can make a request to a network of anonymous nodes and get the consensus result. Hello p2p platforms!</p>
<h3 id="new-frontiers">üí° New Frontiers<a class="headerlink" href="#new-frontiers" title="Permanent link">ÔÉÅ</a></h3>
<p>As we‚Äôve said before, the possibilities for the technology we‚Äôre developing are very broad. From simple things like random number generation to heavier processes like freight management or weather data, a decentralized oracle network is a much needed layer of the trustless future the crypto space is building.
What we‚Äôre truly excited about at Witnet are the ideas developers, innovators and creators will come up with once this tech is fully available for use. Most of the new things that a decentralized oracle can empower are probably outside the realm of our current imagination, which is precisely what drives us to work hard for current and future developers interested in our protocol.</p>
