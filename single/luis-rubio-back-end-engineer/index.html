<p><strong>Hi Luis and welcome to the team. Could you start by telling us a bit about you, your career and academic background?</strong></p>
<p>If I was to highlight one aptitude, I would choose curiosity. I think it is the force that has moved me through my life. It is like a strange addiction that focuses my attention. Curiosity helped me decide to study telecommunications engineering. It was a door to get into a technological world. This gave me the opportunity to approach new and difficult technical challenges. In my last years of university, I focused on robotics and worked with the little humanoid robot NAO. My work helped provide it capabilities to play football and also simulate human interaction to help in Alzheimer patients.</p>
<p>After my degree, my curiosity about robotics was still strong, so I continued in the Centre of Automation and Robotics in Madrid. During this time, I was involved in several projects related to remote handling tasks and ROS programming, an open source environment to develop robotic applications. I was working in some robotic manipulation contests, and developing new research strategies. In addition, I went to Germany to collaborate with another research center, improving the capabilities of a humanoid robot to be telemanipulated in clinical environments with haptic and virtual reality devices.</p>
<p>Now I am ready for my next challenge, which brings me here to Witnet.</p>
<p><strong>Before learning about Witnet, what was your knowledge or experience with cryptocurrencies and blockchain?</strong></p>
<p>If I am being totally sincere, I did not know too much about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I had some general ideas about the space, but no technical experience with it. I think that was one of my main reasons for choosing Witnet, because it gives me the opportunity to learn something totally new.</p>
<p><strong>What aspects of Witnet and what we‚Äôre working on are you most excited about?</strong></p>
<p>As I expressed before, I love exposing myself to new ideas, and I think that cryptocurrencies and blockchains will be an important part of the world. So, I felt the need to get involved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Plus I am happy to work with a group of people like the Witnet team who are not only smart and hard working, but know how to have fun with each other.</p>
<p><strong>What are some things that you like to do outside of your work life?</strong></p>
<p>I have so many hobbies! I love board games - I have more than 30 in my home and I also have designed my own board game.</p>
<p>I am very fascinated by psychology, and enjoy learning how to understand my mind and emotions in life. I also like to play volleyball whenever possible.</p>
<p>I also like to spend time with my girlfriend and my friends. Traveling to new countries is really exciting for me as well, but I also enjoy reading and watching movies at my home.</p>
