<h4 id="hi-anler-welcome-to-the-team-its-awesome-to-have-you-could-you-start-by-telling-us-a-bit-about-you-and-your-background">Hi Anler! Welcome to the team, it’s awesome to have you! Could you start by telling us a bit about you and your background?<a class="headerlink" href="#hi-anler-welcome-to-the-team-its-awesome-to-have-you-could-you-start-by-telling-us-a-bit-about-you-and-your-background" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Hi there! My name is Anler and I’m from Cuba. I learned to program quite late, at the age of 19 when I started university. The languages I used then were C and C++ since I was studying Automation Engineering. I dropped out of university in order to emigrate to Spain where my dad lived. Once in Spain, I immediately was 
<strong>fascinated by the Internet and the amount of information you have at the tips of your fingers</strong>
 , and since that moment 
<strong>I have dedicated my time to learn and teach anything that catches my attention</strong>
 , which is quite a lot.
One of my passions is to teach what I’ve learnt, so 
<strong>I have been a teacher at</strong> <a href="http://ironhack.com">IronHack</a><strong>,</strong> I’m also working together with <a href="https://functionalhub.thinkific.com/">FunctionalHub</a> on a series of courses about functional programming and <strong>I co-created the</strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Haskell-MAD/">Madrid Haskell Users Group</a><strong>to spread out my love for functional programming</strong> and Haskell in particular.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-you-end-up-deciding-to-work-in-the-crypto-space">How did you end up deciding to work in the crypto space?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-you-end-up-deciding-to-work-in-the-crypto-space" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>I just find the whole topic quite attractive and interesting. I think of myself as a frustrated mathematician so that makes 
<strong>cryptography a wonderful space</strong>
 where I can enjoy 
<strong>learning and applying concepts that are deeply-linked to math</strong>
 .
Having the opportunity to know what’s exactly happening in the c 
<strong>rypto space and how that‘s going to shape our future is also priceless</strong>
 for me. Some friends from the Haskell community have created the Blockchain Madrid Haskell Users Group to help others understand the new opportunities and applications that this technology offers.</p>
<h4 id="as-an-experienced-developer-what-kind-of-tools-do-you-use-and-what-makes-them-appropriate-for-your-work">As an experienced developer, what kind of tools do you use and what makes them appropriate for your work?<a class="headerlink" href="#as-an-experienced-developer-what-kind-of-tools-do-you-use-and-what-makes-them-appropriate-for-your-work" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>As a software developer I really don’t need much, just a 
<strong>POSIX system and Emacs</strong>
 , among the required ones I need for a particular problem using a particular technology.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing for me when working on something is the ability to find documentation quickly</strong>
 , that’s why I love Emacs and it’s self-documenting system. I think tools should guide you in how to use them by giving you 
<strong>meaningful error messages and pointing you to the docs</strong>
 when you accidentally use them incorrectly. I think my ideal tool would be a Lisp Machine; I hope some day it comes back to life.</p>

<h4 id="witnet-uses-rust-as-its-back-end-development-language-what-makes-it-suitable-for-the-project-and-what-are-your-favorite-parts-about-it">Witnet uses Rust as its back end development language. What makes it suitable for the project and what are your favorite parts about it?<a class="headerlink" href="#witnet-uses-rust-as-its-back-end-development-language-what-makes-it-suitable-for-the-project-and-what-are-your-favorite-parts-about-it" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Rust is an amazing language</strong>
 . It gives you the control you need when creating critical/high-performance software, and it does so 
<strong>without forcing you to juggle with safety</strong>
 . Carrying the burden of making critical software memory safe is something I do not enjoy at all; 
<strong>I prefer to feed my brain other creative tasks</strong>
 rather than thinking of where I screwed up by freeing the wrong pointer. That’s what machines are for, in my opinion.
For Witnet, it is an 
<strong>obvious choice since it addresses our two main concerns: performance and safety</strong>
 .</p>
<h4 id="there-are-some-great-projects-working-on-inspiring-missions-what-attracted-you-to-witnet-and-what-would-you-say-is-the-potential-of-the-project">There are some great projects working on inspiring missions. What attracted you to Witnet and what would you say is the potential of the project?<a class="headerlink" href="#there-are-some-great-projects-working-on-inspiring-missions-what-attracted-you-to-witnet-and-what-would-you-say-is-the-potential-of-the-project" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Being a 
<strong>young project founded by smart people with a big challenge</strong>
 was the main thing that attracted me to Witnet. I love to learn from others, as well as to work in a family-like environment.
Witnet gives me that along with the 
<strong>opportunity of creating a tool that can help anyone (hopefully everyone)</strong>
 to feed smart contracts verified information that could not be tampered by any entity.</p>

<p>I enjoy to 
<strong>exercise, travel, learn, feed the cats that live in my neighborhood,</strong>
 and specially now, the thing I enjoy the most, is to 
<strong>stroll with my newborn baby around the city</strong>
